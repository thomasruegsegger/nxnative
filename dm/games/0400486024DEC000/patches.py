"""Ocarina v131072's build-checked frame stubs: real-time speed below the target, and a dynamic-resolution ceiling.

The engine stores its final scale after dynamic and fixed-mode selection.
State +0x10 holds the existing host DM_RENDER_SCALE setting; +0x38 / +0x3c the measured frame time.

# Real-time speed. The frame loop (main+0x6e6be0) computes each frame's step as a constant over its target frame rate and never reads the clock: s1 is 60, or 30 in one mode of the game
# (the fcsel at main+0x6e6cc0), s0 the target, so one frame is one step however long it took and everything runs slowly below the target. Found by gunvalk (zortos293/Lichii PR #216).
# The stub keeps that division and takes the larger of it and s1 x the measured frame time (state +0x38, float seconds, hle_nvn.c): 0 there leaves the game's own step, and the step is
# never below it. It marks state +0x3c so the host measures only for a main that reads the value. x16, x17 and s0 are not read again before they are written after the site
